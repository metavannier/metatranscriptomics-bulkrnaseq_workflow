Counts per million matrix used to to apply the filtration method to remove low expressed genes from the analyses.
A requirement for expression in two or more libraries is used as each group contains several replicates.
This ensures that a gene will be retained if it is only expressed in one group.
As a general rule, a good threshold can be chosen by identifying the CPM that corresponds to a count of 10.
